## GSA Digital Worker Identity Handbook
The General Services Administration Office of Government-wide Policy has created a playbook on provisioning an identity for digital workers on federal networks. The goal is to share these best practices with the ISACA GWDC IT Audit, cybersecurity, and Enterprise IT Governance community for improving alignment with OMB memo 19-17 and the use of digital workers in federal networks.
