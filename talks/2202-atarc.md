## Panel: Zero Trust and the Federal Identity-Centric Security Roadmap

In today’s digital world, identity is the new perimeter. To meet the access and usability demands of modern users, agencies are moving towards a more robust and comprehensive security posture that’s centered around the zero-trust principle of “never trust, always verify.” This requires agencies to ensure the RIGHT people have access to the RIGHT data, at the RIGHT time, only when needed or contextual parameters are met.

Tune into this panel to hear from topic experts as they explore how the Federal Identity-Centric Security Roadmap fits in with the advancement of Zero Trust Security. What does the concept of never trust, always verify mean? What are some best practices for verifying users in your network? What challenges have these topic experts experienced as they incorporate Zero Trust within their Federal Identity-Centric Security Roadmap? What solutions have these topic experts come up with?

Panelists:
- John Pretz, Technical Director and Project Officer, Identity Access Management, U.S. Army
- Sean Connelly, TIC Program Manager and Senior Cybersecurity Architect, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
- Ida Mix, Chief Information Security Officer, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce
- Josh Brodbent, Regional Vice President, Public Sector Solutions Engineering, BeyondTrust
- Kenneth Myers, Chief FICAM Architect, Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP), General Services Administration (GSA)
