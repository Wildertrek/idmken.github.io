## Automating ICAM for the Future of Workforce Management
As the workplace expands, identity is imperative to maintain an incentive to collaborate without interruptions or losing hold of a strong cybersecurity posture. As a result, Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) must be made a personalized and protected experience.

Cue automation: Automation presents a viable solution to ICAM risks, empowering organizations to improve workforce security and streamline collaboration. Whether sending out scheduled communications or transferring file ownership from a de-provisioned account, automation plays a pivotal role in shaping a winning workforce. Join Okta and GovExec for an insightful discussion with government experts as we explore use cases for automating identity-based processes and the future of workforce management.
