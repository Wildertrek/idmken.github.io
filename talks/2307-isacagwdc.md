## Privileged Identity and Digital Risk Assessment Playbooks
Privileged users are unique user types that perform various security-related duties. As such, privileged accounts are most likely to be targeted by cybercriminals or abused by malicious insiders. Unwanted behavior or compromised privileged accounts are responsible for the most high-profile federal and private security breaches. It is a critical Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) capability to secure privileged access.

In addition, digital identity represents each individual engaged in an online transaction. However, an individualâ€™s real-life identity may not be known when used to access a digital service. Identity proofing helps establish that the individual is who they claim to be. Digital authentication provides reasonable risk based assurances that the individual accessing the application is the same individual who previously accessed the service.

In this presentation, Dr. Kenneth Myers of the GSA will discuss the Privileged Identity Playbook and Digital Risk Assessment Playbook.
