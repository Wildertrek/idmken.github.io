## Leveraging Derived Credentials to Secure User Access Across the Enterprise 
Phishing continues to be one of the most common internet crimes today, but the stakes have risen enormously as our society has become online-driven. More than 80% of these attacks involve credential misuse in the network. With increased remote workers, users need a seamless mobile device experience  to be able to do their jobs.  

Derived credentials allow agencies to utilize existing investments, adopt modern protocols, and apply phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication across the enterprise.

Join us as thought leaders from government and industry discuss the role that identity and access management can play in meeting zero trust requirements.
