## Breakout - Identity Lifecycle Management Playbook
The Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM) Playbook is a practical guide to help federal agencies understand how to shift the focus from managing the access based on credentials to managing the lifecycle of identities as outlined in section III of OMB Memo 19-17. This focus shift will help agencies achieve a centralized identity management system mentioned in OMB Memo 22-09 Identity Pillar Action 1. This playbook defines ILM as stages of an identity from creation to deactivation. This lifecycle process is known as the joiner-mover-leaver process. The intent of implementing a lifecycle management process is to ensure an agency has visibility into all identities they control.
