## Panel: Working Together for Privacy Protection: The Importance of Identity Management

With the shift to a hybrid workforce, agencies have had to accelerate their digital transformation. This shift has led to a massive influx of valuable data on the web that has become increasingly difficult to manage and track. Many organizations arenâ€™t equipped with adequate security to prevent data theft and fraud, and most consumers lack the awareness that would help them safeguard their own digital identity. Threat actors have taken advantage of this cybersecurity gap, leveraging more sophisticated methods to steal personal information for profit or for their own malicious gain. With technology rapidly advancing, protecting sensitive data must be top of mind for both businesses and consumers.

Tune into this panel to hear from topic experts to discuss the importance of Identity Management within federal agencies as the workforce shifts to a hybrid. What best practices do these topic experts recommend to help best protect data? How can government agencies implement an effective Identity Security model to minimize risk and keep pace with adversaries? What are best practices for Privileged Access Management controls?

Panelists:
- John Pretz, Technical Director and Project Officer, Identity Access Management, U.S. Army
- Ross Foard, ICAM SME, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
- Gregory Hall, Chief Information Security Officer, Office of Information Technology, Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, Department of Justice (DOJ)
- Candace Worley, Chief Product Officer, Ping Identity
- Kenneth Myers, Chief FICAM Architect, Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP), General Services Administration (GSA)

Moderated by Kiersten Patton, Working Group Manager, ATARC.
