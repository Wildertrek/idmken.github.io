## Briefing on Zero Trust Project
Join ACT-IAC and the Cybersecurity COI for an informative program on Zero Trust. At the meeting, you will hear from the ACT-IAC Zero Trust project team about their work related to potential federal agency adoption of zero trust security and modernizing cybersecurity.

Serious cybersecurity incidents demonstrated that current approaches to protecting government systems and data are inadequate.  Todayâ€™s information technology is expanding and evolving into mobile and cloud-enabled environments and has rendered traditional approaches to protecting our government systems and data insufficient. Unless these deficiencies and challenges are addressed effectively and expeditiously, the government will be unable to properly protect our national assets and realize the potential benefits technology advances offer. 

In 2019, ACT-IAC published a report on the [current Zero Trust trends](https://www.actiac.org/zero-trust-cybersecurity-current-trends){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} including with market research, presentations and demonstrations, and evaluation of the underlying trust algorithms. Soon after, ACT-IAC embarked on phase 2 of the Zero Trust project to determine the impact Zero Trust initiatives have currently on federal agencies and help federal agencies start planning for future engagements.
