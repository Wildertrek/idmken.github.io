## Privileged Access Management
Privileged users continue to be the most valuable and targeted accounts within a corporate network. The Federal Government wrote a Privileged Identity Playbook to help all organizations understand why privileged users are important, how to identity privileged accounts, and recommended steps to secure and monitor them.

Presenters:
- Ross Foard; Senior Engineer, Cybersecurity Division @ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
- Kenneth Myers; Director, Identity Assurance and Trusted Access Division @ General Services Administration
