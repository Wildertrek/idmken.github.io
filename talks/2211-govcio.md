## Guide to GSA’s New Privileged Identity Playbook
Identity management is a key factor to creating a robust cybersecurity strategy. GSA’s newly published Privileged Identity Playbook helps federal agencies implement and manage a privileged user management function as part of an overall ICAM program. GSA’s Identity Assurance and Trusted Access Division Director Key Myers and CISA IT Specialist Ross Foard discuss the playbook’s implications and best practices around identity management.
