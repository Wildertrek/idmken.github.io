## Panel: The Journey to Zero Trust: Start with Privilege Protection & Identity Security

June 14, 2021 from 1330 to 1430 ET

A successful Zero Trust model enforces continuous authorization by verifying anyone and everything connected to an enterprise system. We’ve seen in recent headline news that little to no control on identity management can be detrimental if attackers gain access to accounts with elevated privileges. How can government agencies implement an effective Identity Security model to minimize risk and keep pace with adversaries? What are best practices for Privileged Access Management controls?

During this webinar, topic experts and thought leaders will discuss how to manage identity to ensure agencies are aligned with recent policies such as Biden’s Executive Order on Cybersecurity and the NIST 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture.

Panelists:
- Renata Spinks, CTO at the Unisted States Marine Corps Cyberspace Command
- Robert Hankinson, Director of IT Infrastructrure at the United States Department of State
- Sean Connelly, TIC Program Manager at the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency
- Trafenia Salzman, Security Architect at the Small Business Administration
