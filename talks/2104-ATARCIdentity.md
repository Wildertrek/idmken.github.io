## Panel: Identity-Centric Security: The New Agency Perimeter
COVID-19 has accelerated the need for Privileged Identity Management (PIM). As remote agency workforces expand, there is little question that Privileged Identity Management will play an increasingly crucial role in mitigating cyber-attacks. Recent cyber breach news is a reminder that privileged credentials are highly targeted by threat actors.

During this webinar, weâ€™ll discuss:

- Why Privileged Identity Management is a cornerstone of modern IT security, and how it enables agencies to dramatically mitigate risk
- How PIM helps agencies align with evolving compliance mandates and programs such as the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Program and Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM)
- Who, what, where, when, and why for prioritization of PIM
