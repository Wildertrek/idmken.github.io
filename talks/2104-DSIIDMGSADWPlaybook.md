## GSA Digital Worker Identity Handbook
The General Services Administration Office of Government-wide Policy has created a playbook on digital worker identity provisioning on federal networks. The goal is to share these best practices with the DSI community for improving alignment with OMB memo 19-17 and the use of digital workers in federal networks.
