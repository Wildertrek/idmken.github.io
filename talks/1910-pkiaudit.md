## Auditing Federal Identity - Intro to the Federal PKI and PKI Audits
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is one of the most secure ways to protect information, but only if it is implemented properly. There are multiple parties involved and Federal policies and standards to follow otherwise it becomes a secure way to lose information or for malicious actors to encrypt and exfiltrate it. In addition, the Federal PKI is a federated PKI ecosystem of federal agencies and business partners. Not all PKI is Federal PKI and, depending on the use case, shouldnâ€™t be. Come learn about the difference between the Federal PKI and Enterprise PKI in policy, use case, and implementation. We will also cover a general framework for auditing a PKI, the general classes of attacks on PKI operations and how to protect against them, and PKI in the cloud.
