## name of specific agenda item
In today's interconnected and rapidly evolving digital landscape, ensuring secure access to sensitive resources is of paramount importance. There are various methods of securing data and Federal agencies have explored a majority of them. Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) have emerged as two prominent frameworks that enable organizations to address the challenges associated with access control in a dynamic and scalable manner.

In this panel, Federal experts will help provide a comprehensive understanding of ICAM and ABAC and their potential to address access control challenges in today's digital landscape. They will also touch on valuable insights into practical implementation strategies and future directions for these frameworks, enabling them to make informed decisions in designing and deploying effective access control solutions within their organizations.
