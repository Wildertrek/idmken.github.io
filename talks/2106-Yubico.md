## Panel: The President's Cybersecurity Executive Order: Achieve zero trust and strong MFA

With the recent increasing cyber attacks across the government, the Biden administration released a new executive order #14028 on improving the nationâ€™s cybersecurity. It covers many key areas that need to be addressed to protect critical digital infrastructure across the government, importantly - implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) within 180 days, planning for a zero trust architecture within 60 days, and securing the software supply chain.

The panel will discuss the core tenets of the executive order, the various implications for government agencies and software vendors, and immediate steps that organizations can take to ensure they are driving toward the timelines outlined in the executive order.

Panelists:
- Jeremy Grant, Managing Director, Venable (former NIST)
- Ross Norduft, Senior Director Cyber Security Services, Venable (former OMB)
- Kenneth Myers, Chief Federal ICAM Architect at the General Services Administration Office of Government-wide Policy
- Lisa Palma, Cybersecurity Specialist

Moderated by Jeff Phillips, VP Public Sector, Yubico
