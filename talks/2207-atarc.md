## Panel: Keeping Hybrid Work Safe: The Importance of Identity Management
Many organizations still arenâ€™t equipped with adequate security to prevent data theft and fraud, and most consumers lack the awareness that would help them safeguard their own digital identity. Threat actors have taken advantage of this cybersecurity gap, leveraging more sophisticated methods to steal personal information for profit or for their own malicious gain. With technology rapidly advancing and the continuation of the hybrid workforce, protecting sensitive data must be top of mind for both businesses and consumers. 

Tune into this panel to hear as topic experts discuss the importance of Identity Management within federal agencies and how the hybrid workforce has affected it. What best practices do these topic experts recommend to help best protect data? How can government agencies implement an effective Identity Security model to minimize risk and keep pace with adversaries? What are best practices for Privileged Access Management controls?
