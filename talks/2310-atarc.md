## Identity Governance; A Critical Enabler of Zero Trust
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-22-09 requires “agencies to achieve specific zero trust security goals.” It designates “Identity” as the first five pillars of CISA’s zero trust maturity model. Additionally, M-22-09 provides specific actions for the Identity pillar, including employing centralized identity management systems that integrate with agency applications and platforms, leveraging phishing-resistant MFA throughout their enterprise, and using device-level signals and other data for access authorization decisions. 

Identity governance involves managing roles, segregating duties, performing analytics, maintaining logs, and generating reports. These components collectively enable organizations to manage access to organizational resources to promote mission accomplishment while mitigating risk. This webinar will focus on the opportunities and current challenges in using identity governance approaches to achieve zero-trust cybersecurity goals. Panelists will discuss the current or envisioned use of identity governance methods and tools within their organization and share lessons learned for the identity pillar on their journey towards zero trust.
