## Breaking Into Identity Management with Azure
Do we do anything online that does not require a login? Nothing, right? Identity management is a critical skill that few think about because it just works (most of the time...) and is actually required for almost everything we do online and in person. Authentication is baked into all IT skills from system administrators, database administrators, developers and more. Whether youâ€™re verifying your identity for a new bank account to logging in to your email, identity is all around us. Join this session hosted by Ken Myers to learn, with hands on demos In Azure, about identity management.
