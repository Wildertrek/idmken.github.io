## Successfully Managing AI Machine Identities for Digital Workers (Virtual only)
Federal agencies use digital workers to automate processes, increase efficiencies, and discover insights from large volumes of data. Digital workers may use Artificial Intelligence, Chatbots or Machine Learning to interact with or use sensitive information to perform unattended, high-risk tasks, which may critically impact an agency’s mission. Find out why using human-based processes to create a digital worker identity may hinder a digital worker’s access or success. Ken and Ross will discuss the challenges in determining digital worker risk and describe a playbook for establishing digital worker identity. 

Presenters:
- Ross Foard; IT Specialist, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Division @ Department of Homeland Security
- Kenneth Myers; Director, Identity Assurance and Trusted Access Division @ General Services Administration
