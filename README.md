a site about Ken Myers

Welcome to my site! My name is Ken Myers and I have a passion for anything identity management. Our physical and digital identities are at the center of everything we do. From meeting new people, to buying stuff online, and even trying to gain access to an application at work.

Check out my talks and youtube videos.
