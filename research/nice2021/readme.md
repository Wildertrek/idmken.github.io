# NIST NICE Framework

The [NIST NICE Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/nice-framework-resource-center) provides a set of building blocks for describing the tasks, knowledge, and skills that are needed to perform cybersecurity work performed by individuals and teams. Through these building blocks, the NICE Framework enables organizations to develop their workforces to perform cybersecurity work, and it helps learners to explore cybersecurity work and to engage in appropriate learning activities to develop their knowledge and skills.

This repository converted the NIST NICE Framework elements into individual yaml files.
