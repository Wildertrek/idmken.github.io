# NIST NICE Ontology Model

This research builds on an exploratory analysis conducted by Kim et al. (2018). In this analysis, Kim et al. used Protege ontology software to identify similarities between government, academic, and private sector cybersecurity work role data.

The intent of this research is to publish the data set created and analyzed by Kim et al. (2018) for others to use and build upon.

The [NIST NICE Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/nice-framework-resource-center){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} provides a set of building blocks for describing the tasks, knowledge, and skills that are needed to perform cybersecurity work performed by individuals and teams. Through these building blocks, the NICE Framework enables organizations to develop their workforces to perform cybersecurity work, and it helps learners to explore cybersecurity work and to engage in appropriate learning activities to develop their knowledge and skills.

This repository converted the NIST NICE Framework Revision 1 elements into individual yaml files.
