| ISACA Journal | Meeting the Demand for Zero Trust Talent | 02/2022 | Zero trust is unique because it maintains strict data control. It promotes persistent and secure data at all times, regardless of data being at rest, in transit or in use, agnostic to who or what is accessing them. Based on these benefits and the changing times, organizations are motivated to implement zero trust architectures. However, they do not seem to realize how important a tool the cybersecurity workforce is to successfully implementing zero trust. | Co-Author | [ISACA Journal](https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2022/volume-3/meeting-the-demand-for-zero-trust-talent){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} |

| N/A | ACT-IAC Zero Trust Phase 2 Project | 05/2021 | As part of the project team's effort in information agencies on the current status of Zero Trust in the Federal government, we conducted a series of interviews and surveys with federal agencies and the vendor community. We analyzed and found five/six core zero trust use cases common across both the agency and vendor community. Each use case explains a current state approach, a zero-trust approach objective, a value proposition from zero-trust, and a recommended starting point for a pilot. We thank those agencies and vendors who provided feedback. | Use Case Working Group Co-Chair | 1.
