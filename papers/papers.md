| N/A | Zero Trust Project - Use Cases | 04/2021 | As part of the project team's effort in information agencies on the current status of Zero Trust in the Federal government, we conducted a series of interviews and surveys with federal agencies and the vendor community. We analyzed and found five/six core zero trust use cases common across both the agency and vendor community. Each use case explains a current state approach, a zero-trust approach objective, a value proposition from zero-trust, and a recommended starting point for a pilot. We thank those agencies and vendors who provided feedback. | Working Group Co-Chair | [actiac.org](https://www.actiac.org/page/zero-trust-project-use-cases){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} |
