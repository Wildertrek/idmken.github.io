| N/A | ACT-IAC Zero Trust Phase 2 Project | 05/2021 | As part of the project team's effort in information agencies on the current status of Zero Trust in the Federal government, we conducted a series of interviews and surveys with federal agencies and the vendor community. We analyzed and found five/six core zero trust use cases common across both the agency and vendor community. Each use case explains a current state approach, a zero-trust approach objective, a value proposition from zero-trust, and a recommended starting point for a pilot. We thank those agencies and vendors who provided feedback. | Use Case Working Group Co-Chair | [Zero Trust Report](https://www.actiac.org/document/zero-trust-report-lessons-learned-vendor-and-partner-research){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  [Use Case Report](https://www.actiac.org/page/zero-trust-project-use-cases){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} |
