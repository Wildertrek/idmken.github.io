Do you love seeing the fruits of your labor via regular customer feedback and delivering measurable improvements? You might be who we’re looking for.

In this role, you and your team will ensure safe and secure access across all of AppFolio Property Manager, keeping millions of users and their data safe by taking a customer-centric approach to balancing security and convenience.

Participate in customer research/discovery with Product partners to understand customer problems, needs, and estimate technical feasibility of various potential solutions.
Work in a truly agile fashion to turn unruly problems into thinly sliced deliverables and execute quickly against them while limiting work in progress.
Hold a high bar of engineering excellence and always look for ways to raise it. Adopt our engineering best practices, provide and receive in-depth code reviews, and participate in healthy debate as a team. Evangelize your own expertise and experience among your teammates and the rest of the organization.
Prioritize quality. Thoughtful test coverage is a given and any escalations from external stakeholders like customer care are handled and resolved swiftly.
Together with your team, your solutions are always well-instrumented. Queries and dashboards are easily accessible and regularly used to drive decisions as well as measure and celebrate progress.
Enthusiastically participate in a high performing, empowered team with high levels of mutual trust and respect. As part of an empowered team, you will take ownership of your problem space - reflecting and growing from our failures and celebrating our successes.

Director - Data Architecture

GSK R&D and Digital and Tech’s collective goal is to deliver business impact, including the acceleration the discovery and development of medicines and vaccines to patients. The R&D Digital and Tech remit has expanded over the past 2 years, and to position GSK for the future, the significantly expanded leadership role is required on the R&D Digital and Tech Leadership team. The change will strengthen the R&D Tech LT, to provide more strategic impact, focus, accountability, and improved decision making in the use of Digital, Data and Analytics (DDA) to strengthen the pipeline.


As R&D enters a new era of data driven science, there is a need to create capability to ensure that R&D have high quality data captured with context and aligned data models, so that the data is useable and reusable for a variety of use cases. These range from data driven decision making, through to data sciences and AI/ML capability to enable data driven science. As a result, it is essential that Digital & Tech can surface the data from operational systems into a harmonised storage layer and controlled presentation data fabrics and mesh. To do this there is a need to build out a Data Engineering capability that can build the required architecture, data strategy and implement an engineering approach. And a leader is required to build this capability within the Scientific Data & Tech organisation in R&D Digital & Tech, and then industrialise the approaches and practises around Data architecture and delivery.


GSK is one of the world’s foremost pharmaceutical and vaccines companies and we are proud to be leading a healthcare revolution. R&D plays a critical role in the GSK strategy to get ahead of disease with a strong portfolio of commercially launched products in Vaccines, Specialty Biologics, Respiratory and HIV, and General Medicines. The R&D network comprises 5 key R&D hubs, and several smaller sites, spanning Europe and the USA, supporting over 8000 GSK scientists and third-party suppliers. Additionally, R&D has an exciting portfolio of new therapies in development with significant commercial launches planned over the next 5 years. Data and Analytics allows us to integrate, simplify and unlock insights using all our data to drive innovation, decision-making, and enable our transformation in service of our patients, healthcare professionals and consumers, as R&D moved into a new era of Data Driven Science.


The Data Engineering Director - Data Architecture will lead significant expansion into data as an asset, which GSK is driving to be best in class, to unlock data to insight to meet the exponential scale of data production and rapid insight creation required by Research, Medicine Development and Supply and Vaccines R&D objectives.


The primary accountability and responsibility of the Data Engineering Director - Data Architecture is to build and lead an organization responsible for enterprise data architecture, providing thought leadership and architecture design for all aspects of data across the Scientific area from early research through to clinical manufacture and supply, ensuring that the architecture and models are compliant with our partner organisations like supply chain, Onyx and Development. This includes implementation of the data architecture onto, and augmentation of, the two GSK data platform for CMC and Research needs, design and creation of pipelines to consolidate data to a known standard and quality from our operational systems, design and creation of data services and data fabrics for the harmonised surfacing of data, to support advanced analytics, data visualizations, master data management, knowledge engineering, real world data, data acquisition, integration, machine learning and AI/ML. This role will build and contribute to target architectures, and build and maintain technical standards and data management approaches in a cloud-native ecosystem that enable maximum benefit to be obtained by data and analytics capabilities. In doing so, ensure that these are aligned across both the R&D and Digital & Tech strategies. The role will define, create, and drive the adaption of standards and data architecture to ensure all aspects of data provisioning, harmonisation and utilisation delivers value in alignment with business objectives.


The Data Engineering Director - Data Architecture brings a distinct and deep knowledge about the highly complex, heterogeneous world of science and how data architecture plays a significant role to support Science, Data and Analytics, where multiple distinct specialties need to combine.

Consequently, deep knowledge of the distinct data types applicable to CMC, laboratories and Research and ontological standards (e.g. from SEND safety format to S88 manufacturing standards) are critical to shaping effective delivery for the associated data engineering organisation.

The leader will leverage this knowledge to test and ensure the data architecture strategy is designed and implemented robustly, ensuring that there is a rapid scale-up of data engineering output based on the architecture to bring in complementary expertise in data architecture skills from outside of scientific research or the pharmaceutical industry. R&D is a highly complex and regulated environment and therefore the leader would need to have deep knowledge of the applicable business area to be successful in this role.

And through all these processes this leader would work with colleagues in Scientific Digital and Tech, Development, and Global to supply chain to ensure the data flows within an aligned data architecture and data models between the environments in a seamless manner.

Key Responsibilities

Establish, prioritize, and maintain the overall Scientific Data & Tech Data Architecture strategy and approach in alignment, co-creation, and on-going partnership with our key stakeholders in Onyx, Development and Global Supply Chain.

Build and lead an organization responsible for enterprise data architecture, providing thought leadership and architecture services for all aspects of data, including data platforms, data pipelines and fabrics, data ontologies, data quality, master data management, and all other elements of the data environment.

Principal PM Manager - Conditional Access (Identity Access Management),manager,"The Identity Security team is focused on protecting our customers from unauthorized access. Our team’s efforts save individuals from account compromise and safeguard transactions powering the global digital economy.

Azure AD Conditional Access is Microsoft’s adaptive access policy solution which takes in all available data points and makes explicit access decisions. Conditional Access is used by thousands of organizations and millions of users across the globe. Gartner (leading analyst research firm) has said that Conditional Access is one of the strengths for Azure AD and a popular and heavily leveraged adaptive access tool.

This is where you come in – we are looking for a leader for the Conditional Access product team.

In this role, you will lead a diverse team of Product Managers building new Conditional Access features. You will guide your team to work closely with customers to identify customer pain in the access policy area, design end-to-end solutions that address those problems, validate them with customers and stakeholders and see them through to completion in partnership with your engineering team. You will attract, hire, manage, grow, and retain talent.

Success in this role will require a strong focus on driving usage partnering with customer experience teams and performing in-product experimentation to drive growth.

This role will require a lot of cross-team collaboration across disciplines and the company. If you thrive on building on other’s work and thinking of how to deliver integrated holistic products for our customers, this role is for you.

We pride ourselves on building strong relationships with customers so we can deeply understand their requirements and deliver solutions that satisfy their needs and exceed their expectations.
