## Introduction
Identity and Access Management is a vital cybersecurity capability. It is included in multiple academic cybersecurity curriculum and certification knowledge domains. Within the U.S. Federal Government, Identity and Access Management are referred to as Identity, Credential, and Access Management or ICAM (pronounced eye-CAM). This slight variation places additional emphasis on the use of credentials. The Federal ICAM architecture (GSA, 2020) includes five essential ICAM process areas. 

1.	Identity Management – How to collect, verify, and manage identity attributes.
2.	Credential Management – How to issue, manage, and revoke authenticators bound to identities.
3.	Access Management – How to authenticate identities and authorize appropriate access to protected resources.
4.	Governance – The set of practices and principles that guide ICAM functions, activities, and outcomes.
5.	Federation – Technology, policies, and processes allow an organization to accept identity attributes and credentials managed by a different organization.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) identified identity management, a component of ICAM, as a technical cybersecurity competency and referenced the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) National Initiative of Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework (OPM, 2015) as the primary source for identifying and defining cybersecurity work roles, tasks, knowledge, and skills. However, the NIST NICE Framework (Petersen, Santos, Smith, Wetzel, & Witte, 2020) does not include specific ICAM roles. ICAM-related tasks are usually within broader roles such as system administrator or database administrator. 

The Office of Management and Budget requires all U.S. government agencies to implement a specific ICAM architecture called the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Architecture (OMB, 2019). Based on this policy and the discrepancy between OPM and the NIST NICE Framework, a gap exists in that U.S. Federal Agencies are required to implement a comprehensive ICAM architecture yet do not have defined ICAM work roles and competencies to ensure it is implemented and operated correctly. In other words, what ICAM work roles and competencies are needed to implement an ICAM architecture? What are the foundational ICAM architecture areas? If ICAM is identified in its own OMB memo, why doesn't U.S. federal cybersecurity workforce planning point to ICAM work roles and competencies? The purpose of this paper is to identify an ICAM competency model that aligns with the Federal ICAM architecture using the NIST NICE Framework to design tasks, knowledge, and skills. It will accomplish this by demonstrating a model for creating work roles and competencies derived from a specific cybersecurity architecture. In essence, an organization would orient its cybersecurity workforce based on the cybersecurity architecture it is implementing. The following section will discuss the literature search strategy deployed in writing this paper.

## Literature Search Strategy
The majority of past and current work specific to ICAM involves general cybersecurity workforce planning or more specific technical ICAM solutions and challenges. This paper's search strategy employed a three-step process. See figure 1 for literature search strategy results.
    
1.	Perform a search from two distinct vectors: cybersecurity workforce planning and identity, credential, and access management topics using a lexicon of ICAM terms mined from the Federal ICAM Architecture.
2.	Narrow search results by adding modifiers such as publication date in the last five years and publication type.
3.	Review literature for relevance and applicability.

It is interesting to point out the latest ICAM-related topics involve using blockchain technology for distributed identity systems and federation security. As defined in the Federal ICAM architecture, federation is sharing identity information and attributes between organizations. The following section will discuss the conceptual framework researched as part of the literature review.

## Conceptual Framework
The conceptual framework used as part of the literature argument includes five steps.

1.	Based on the Verizon Data Breach Report (2020), most breach attack vectors exploit an ICAM process.
2.	ICAM processes are usually implemented using a cybersecurity framework or standards such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27000, or other regulatory frameworks.
3.	Cybersecurity frameworks and regulatory standards are often cited as tasks or knowledge statements regarding work roles. For example, a system administrator familiar with "implementing access control techniques cited in NIST 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations".
4.	Work roles often include ICAM tasks spread across multiple positions but do not uniquely identify specific ICAM roles leading to a disjointed ICAM implementation.
5.	Specific ICAM roles are needed to reduce breaches that exploit ICAM processes.

The framework recommends a pivot towards creating a cybersecurity team aligned with the cybersecurity architecture of the organization. In the next section, the paper will review past and current literature on the topic.

## Review of the Literature     
The literature is divided into three sections to align with the conceptual framework of the literature argument. It starts by identifying sources to ICAM-related adversary tactics, techniques, and attack vectors and then moves to practices protecting data and defend against attacks. The next is on building a cybersecurity team around an implemented cybersecurity framework.
	
### Adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Common Attack Vectors
The top two exploit actions in the 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report included phishing and stolen credentials (Verizon Enterprise, 2020). Phishing is a technique to trick a user into disclosing information such as a username and password (a credential). An adversary can then masquerade as the user (NIST, 2021c). Stolen credentials are similar to phishing in that credentials are compromised, potentially through a credential database release, and then used to gain unauthorized access to resources. In both examples, a multi-factor authenticator or prompting the user for an additional factor such as a PIN code is implemented to decrease the opportunity to use phished or stolen credentials (Grassi, Garcia, & Fenton, 2017).
		
Additionally, large organizations may also implement federation to decrease the number of passwords in use and increase multi-factor authentication. Still, this technique can also be abused, as pointed out by the National Security Agency in 2020 (NSA, 2020). This specific type of attack is referred to as the Golden Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) technique and successfully exploited as part of the SolarWinds-related breach activity in 2021 (Reiner, 2020). Tan, Li, Yin, & and Deng (2020) spoke of similar exploits to implementing security protocols but found one main weakness in ensuring "someone who is familiar with the protocol specification and has a well understanding of cryptography and information security should be recruited" to implement authentication and authorization protocol. The same issue is mentioned by Li & Mitchell (2020, p. 670) in regards to implementing well-known federation protocols such as OAuth and Open ID Connect in that "Relying Partys do not always implement OAuth 2.0 correctly; as a result, many real-world OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect systems are vulnerable to attack". The inverse of this concept would be inconsistent implementation of authentication and authorization protocols could be the leading contributing factor to many credential-related breaches. Authentication and authorization are ICAM processes within Access Management.

### Defend Against Attacks Using Cybersecurity Frameworks and Education
Multiple works support the idea that ICAM processes are an essential cybersecurity capability. The Cybersecurity Curricula 2017 are guidelines for post-secondary degree programs in cybersecurity. It identifies identity management, access control, and authentication as crucial areas of broader cybersecurity areas (ACM, IEEE, AIS, & IFIP, 2017, p. 111). Leading certifications include ICAM processes as major knowledge domains, such as 13% of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) (ISC2, 2021) exam and 16% of the CompTIA Security+ exam (CompTIA, 2021). The Cyber Body of Knowledge includes an "Authentication, Authorization & Accountability" domain, but it's one of 19 other domains (University of Bristol , 2020). In addition, there is an ICAM focused non-profit called "IDPro" who published a body of knowledge on the multiple areas of ICAM, including workforce and consumer identity, laws, access control, project management, non-human entities, digital identity, and a few others (IDPro’s Body of Knowledge, 2020). This body of knowledge is an assortment of articles rather than a formal publication, but the goal of IDPro is to eventually make it a formal publication. 

In addition to ICAM processes in academic and certification material, it is also included in a number of cybersecurity architectures. Within the NIST Special Publication 800-207 on Zero Trust Architecture, identity governance is one of three approaches to implementing a zero trust architecture (Rose, Borchert, Mitchell, & & Connelly, 2020). The version 1.1 update of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework identified the importance of ICAM process by refining the access control category “to better account for authentication, authorization, and identity proofing” (NIST, 2018, p. 2). The U.S. Government has a specific cybersecurity solution architecture called the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation or CDM Program. Phase two of four of the CDM Program focuses on who is on the network and breaks it down into four areas of TRUST (identity proofing), BEHAVE (user security training), CRED (credentialing), and PRIV (privileged account management) (DHS, 2018). These four areas align with the Federal ICAM Architecture (GSA, 2020) of which U.S. Federal Agencies are required to implement the Federal ICAM Architecture potentially using CDM Program integrators. Many standards identify the need to implement potentially advanced ICAM processes. Yet, most sources only provide a basic knowledge of the concept of ICAM processes rather than how to implement them effectively.

### Build Your Cybersecurity Team
Cybersecurity workforce planning follows much the same path as academic material. 	In 2011, Schneider and Mulligan talked about how "Governments, realizing that policy must be a crucial ingredient of any solution, are starting to flex their regulatory and legislative muscle" regarding cybersecurity policies. They concluded government doctrine or direction provided vital support for cybersecurity success (Schneider & Mulligan, 2011, p. 4). We can see U.S. government support in the NIST NICE Framework, which is "built upon a set of discrete building blocks that describe the work to be done (in the form of Tasks) and what is required to perform that work (through Knowledge and Skills)" (Petersen, Santos, Smith, Wetzel, & Witte, 2020, p. 4). Kim, Smith, Yang, & Kim identified the potential of the NIST NICE Framework as a bridge “to find similar academic courses and hire graduating students or find qualified government employees” (2018, p. 4) that align with NIST NICE knowledge, skills, abililities, and tasks. Government support is a crucial enabler, and a framework exists to help define cybersecurity workforce competencies.	 
		
Given that so many cybersecurity frameworks and curriculum point to all cybersecurity professionals have a basic understanding of ICAM processes, why aren’t there more advanced courses related to ICAM processes? Very few sources point expressly to “why ICAM” but more generally on the state of cybersecurity curriculum development. Cabaj, Domingos, Kotulski, & Respício share most cybersecurity programs are “aligned with the available faculty and expertise” (2018, p. 35). While this is true that your content may be limited to the knowledge available, they also point to the need to “incorporate more specific security courses into a set of core courses and offer more elective courses” around non-core topics (Cabaj, Domingos, Kotulski, & Respício, 2018, p. 34). Many authors agree that one of the most significant challenges in teaching cybersecurity curriculum is staying current (Bicak, Liu, & Murphy, 2015) (Hoag, 2013). This may be why institutions leverage more adjunct professors in cybersecurity courses than in other domains because they have more current and relevant work experience (Ran & Sanders, 2020).
		
While multiple publications identify essential ICAM skills and knowledge, they mainly concern broader cybersecurity roles rather than specific ICAM roles. On the same topic, Furnell proposed incorporating a work role maturity model “to recognize the importance of fostering a great community of practitioners at all levels” (Furnell, 2020, p. 6). This maturity model identified six levels from basic to expert, with defined competencies at each level. Given the lack of non-vendor ICAM certifications or training opportunities, it could be assumed that most individuals are trained at the basic level, which may lead to why there are a significant number of breaches that exploit ICAM processes. Gordon (2016) points out that federation is a focus and building block for the cloud security professional, a Federal ICAM architecture domain but excluded from most discussions on access management and access control. This also leads one to see that ICAM processes are more critical when operating a cloud or hybrid architecture. The following section will discuss the synthesis of literature findings.

## Synthesis of Literature Findings
Previous work points to ICAM processes as essential and included in various cybersecurity workforce and academic curricula yet not defined as specific work roles in the same fashion as a system administrator or a cybersecurity analyst. Due to the lack of advanced ICAM specific training, it could be assumed that most professionals implementing ICAM processes only have a basic knowledge of ICAM. This may explain why the 2020 Verizon Breach report included ICAM-related attack vectors as two of the top five breach reasons (Verizon Enterprise, 2020). While an ICAM body of knowledge exists, it does not identify how to hire, train, and retain ICAM professionals. An ICAM competency model is needed to highlight the need for ICAM-trained professionals while also closing the gap of ICAM-related exploits. 

This paper takes the Federal ICAM architecture as a starting point to build an ICAM competency model. The purpose of this approach is simplicity. If an organization wants to implement this architecture, it seems like a natural fit. Their workforce should be structured in a way to implement and manage it. The Federal ICAM architecture (GSA, 2020) is a U.S. government reference architecture designed for federal agencies. Still, many of the capabilities and services are common for all organizations in that all organizations should manage identities, credentials, and access.
	Current academic research points to the need for all cybersecurity professionals to have a basic knowledge of ICAM processes. Does basic knowledge suffice to implement and operate advanced ICAM processes? Many indicators point to no in that ICAM-processes are some of the most exploited attack vectors in breaches. 

## Summary
The literature review intended to introduce and demonstrate a cybersecurity workplace planning model designed around implementing a specific cybersecurity framework or architecture. It helps identify that ICAM processes were essential to cybersecurity curricula, workforce planning, and certification courses. Yet, defined ICAM work roles do not exist or are organizationally defined, which leads to a disparity in determining a clear career path for ICAM professionals. This may lead to further challenges when trying to find “the right fit” for hiring or training employees. While organizations can use this ICAM competency model based on the Federal ICAM architecture, it is not without limitations. The Federal ICAM architecture is written and maintained by and for the U.S. Federal government. It may be updated in the future to further orient itself toward the government rather than fairly agnostic to most organizations.
