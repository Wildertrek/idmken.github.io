## Reflecting on Research

My Research Topic:	Where have all the (F)Identirati gone? An Identity and Access Management Competency Model for the U.S. Federal Government

Research Questions:
1.	With the importance of Identity and Access Management identified with its own OMB memo 2019, why doesn’t the U.S. government have identity and access management work roles and competencies?
2.	What are the foundational identity and access management architecture areas?
3.	How can a curriculum incorporate identity and access management training modules into a broader cybersecurity program?

| Obama Administration wrote a Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy	| Donovan, S., Cobert, B., Daniel, M., and Scott, T. (2016, July 16). Strengthening the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce. The White House President Barack Obama. https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/07/12/strengthening-federal-cybersecurity-workforce |
| There are wide variations in the quality and security of identification used to gain access to secure facilities where there is potential for terrorist attacks. In order to eliminate these variations, U.S. policy is to enhance security, increase Government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy by establishing a mandatory, Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government to its employees and contractors (including contractor employees). This directive mandates a federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identification.	| White House. (2020, April 23). Homeland security presidential directive 12.

## Previous research and it’s limitations

| Relevant points to include in relation to your own research topic | Key references |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
Cybersecurity is a relatively new field that doesn’t always integrate neatly with other computing programs. Online learning and co-op education, can appear threatening or too difficult to incorporate for universities.	Hoffman, L., Burley, D., & Toregas, C. (2012). Holistically building the cybersecurity workforce. IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine, 10(2), 33–39. https://doi.org/10.1109/msp.2011.181

	To remain up to date with the developments in the area and market needs, cybersecurity master programs evolve. Their evolution includes updating the contents of their courses as well as changing the structure of programs to incorporate more specific security courses into the set of core courses and to offer more elective courses. We point out that this evolution has been aligned with the available faculty and expertise.	Cabaj, K., Domingos, D., Kotulski, Z., & Respício, A. (2018). Cybersecurity education: Evolution of the discipline and analysis of master programs. Computers & Security, 75, 24–35. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2018.01.015
	A third area of focus is federated identity access management and single sign-on. Online operations increasingly require the use of common credentials to access multiple systems and services, such as the use of Google, Microsoft, or Facebook credentials to log into various websites. Federated identity access management and single sign-on technologies provide this ability. Often, a group of organizations will share identity attributes based on security frameworks, trust, standards, and policies.	Gordon, A. (2016). The Hybrid Cloud Security Professional. IEEE Cloud Computing, 3(1), 82–86. https://doi.org/10.1109/mcc.2016.21
	What we have learned from recent work is how important it is to understand the topology of the application. Our approach considers a separation of duties between a security architect (i.e., who is an expert in security and understands the topology of the application), a Cloud provider, and application developers. We allow the security architect to describe the security infrastructure and express his requirements (the “what”). We let the Cloud provider provision the security infrastructure to protect the application according to the requirements (the “how”).	Vo, T. H., Fuhrmann, W., & Fischer-Hellmann, K.-P. (2017). How to adapt authentication and authorization infrastructure of applications for the cloud. 2017 IEEE 5th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud), 54–61. https://doi.org/10.1109/ficloud.2017.14
	IAM is a solution to manage the access of resources which includes verifying the user and authorization based on the protected resources and user’s role.	Sharma, A., Sharma, S., & Dave, M. (2015). Identity and access management- a comprehensive study. 2015 International Conference on Green Computing and Internet of Things (ICGCIoT), 1481–1485. https://doi.org/10.1109/icgciot.2015.7380701
	 We propose two areas of future research: one, examine which techniques are appropriate for assessing more granular role types, such as breaking security practitioner into security architect and penetration tester, and two, assess cost-effectiveness by including a quantitative metric of cost similar to what has already been done for assurance techniques.	Knowles, W., Such, J. M., Gouglidis, A., Misra, G., & Rashid, A. (2017). All That Glitters Is Not Gold: On the Effectiveness of Cybersecurity Qualifications. Computer, 50(12), 60–71. https://doi.org/10.1109/mc.2017.4451226
	First of all, for the inconsistent implementation, someone who is familiar with the protocol specification and has a well understanding of cryptography and information security should be recruited.	Tan, Y., Li, W., Yin, J., & Deng, Y. (2020). A universal decentralized authentication and authorization protocol based on Blockchain. 2020 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC), 7–14. https://doi.org/10.1109/cyberc49757.2020.00012
	Our ontological network for the cybersecurity ecosystem is not based off current market trends and behaviors. Further research needs to be done with empirical data from the field. When translating the private sector into KSATs, this came with some subjectivity. We used multiple coders for validation, there is still room for interpretation.	Kim, K., Smith, J., Yang, T. A., & Kim, D. J. (2018). An exploratory analysis on cybersecurity ecosystem utilizing the NICE framework. 2018 National Cyber Summit (NCS), 1–7. https://doi.org/10.1109/ncs.2018.00006

	In the past few weeks, we’ve been witnessing one of the most elaborate supply-chain attacks unfold with a threat actor that infected SolarWinds Orion source code and used the update process to get to around 18,000 victims all around the globe. One of the most (if not the most) innovative techniques used in this attack, now known as Solorigate, is the “Golden SAML” technique.	Reiner, S. (2020, December 29).
