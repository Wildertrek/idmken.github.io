# Where have all the (F)Identirati gone? An Identity and Access Management Competency Model

My proposed topic title is â€œWhere have all the (F)Identirati gone? An Identity and Access Management Competency Model". The purpose of my research is to establish identity and access management work roles, tasks, knowledge, and skills aligned with a competency model to help the U.S Federal Government hire, train, and retain Identity and Access Management professionals. 

Identity is an important topic. The 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report found that phishing and credential theft are among the top threat actions in breaches. A mitigation tactic is to implement multi-factor authentication, an access management service. 
- A quick search on USAjobs.gov found zero results for "multi-factor authentication" and nine results for "access management" (USAJobs.gov, 2020). 
- A LinkedIn job search (2020) returned 13,137 for access management and 152 for multi-factor authentication. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) identified identity management as a technical cybersecurity competency. However, the NIST NICE Framework (Petersen, 2020) fails to include it as a work role and only includes two identity-related skills and one knowledge reference. Additionally, the Office of Management and Budget requires all U.S. government agencies to implement a specific identity architecture called the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Architecture (OMB, 2019). A gap exists in that U.S. Federal Agencies are required to implement a comprehensive identity architecture yet do not have defined work roles to ensure it is implemented and operated properly.

The basis of my research will include several sources to include a skills model based on Peterson (2020), a competency model based on Furnell (2020), and skill and knowledge statements from GSA (2020). I expect to develop an identity competency model with defined work roles, tasks, skills, and knowledge statements.
